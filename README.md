## Project Motivation

    These days, it is necessary to have a helthier life by exercising and eating well.
    But eating well is not only stop or start to eat some type of food!!
    According to your gender, age & height you can calculate your ideal weight and the calories
    you must consume every day.
    The calories consumed are divided in Proteins, Carbohydrates & Fats.
    The intention is to make a comparison between the needed calories and the ones actually consumed in a period of one 
    month and with that information, calculate the weight you will have at the end of that month.

### Questions

1. How close are the calories we consume vs the ones we need? \
    For the purpose of the 1st part of the project, we are working with a random sample of the food consumed.\
    We sume the total grams of proteins, carbohydrates & fats and compare them with the ones needed.\
    After a month, we can see how far or close the person is for the grams needed for each nutrient.
    
2. What would be the weight we will have at the end of one month with the food we consume?\
    Considering the amount of calories ingested each day, we calculate the kg gained or lost per day and the end
    of the month, we can see the final weight.


### Data

We get two databases from the USDA:
   1) A list of food products
   2) The nutrients for each product\

From the database **Products** we got a code which is *unique* for each product and then match the code with the info in the
database **Nutrients** to get the information for each nutrient: *Protein, Carbohydrate* or *Fat*.


## Data Cleanup & Exploration


Describe the exploration and cleanup process
Discuss insights you had while exploring the data that you didn't anticipate
Discuss any problems that arose after exploring the data, and how you resolved them
Present and discuss interesting figures developed during exploration, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook
